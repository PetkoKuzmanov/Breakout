# Breakout
Assignment for CSC 384

This is my assignment for the Introduction to video game programming module. It is my implementation of the Breakout game. It is developed in Unity with C#. It has all the core features of the game. The assignment required the game to have more features such as profile menu, profile stats, game replays, tutorial and animations. I have also added achievements and sounds.
