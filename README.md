# Breakout

This is my assignment for the Introduction to video game programming module. It is my implementation of the Breakout game. It is developed in **Unity** with **C#**. 

## Description :memo:

My implementation has all the core features of Breakout. In addition to that, the assignment required the game to have more features such as:
* Main menu
* Profile menu
* Profile stats
* Game replays
* Tutorial 
* Menu animations

I have also added:
* Achievements
* Sounds
